               simpler times of the summer of 2013…back when pizzas came by the slice, jalapeño ranch flowed free, 
               and Meatzilla was Oak Cliff's most beloved OG. Started by Cane Rosso founder/owner, Jay Jerrier, Zoli's 
               was the perfect antidote to Cane Rosso's precious Neapolitan-style 
              pizza and strict adherence to VPN guidelines. Zoli's ain't got no time for that.” </p>
